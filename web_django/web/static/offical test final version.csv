Task and Procedure

Thanks for accepting the HIT! In this HIT, you will take approximately 10 mins to complete a math quiz. The quiz has two parts. In the first part, you will be asked to answer 5 easy math questions. After that, you can take a 20s break and then go to the second part, which includes 5 relatively difficult math questions. All of them are selected from SAT practice test.



You have 5 mins to complete the easy questions, and 5 mins for the difficult questions. To avoid guessing, it takes 30 seconds to enable the submit button in each part. For compensation, You will receive 5 cents as base payment, additionally, you will receive 20 cents for each correct answer in the easy part and 25 cents for each correct answer in the hard part.
