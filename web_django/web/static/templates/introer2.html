			<h1>What tasks did workers do?</h1>
      <p> <strong>You will see some information about the workers to help you make the hiring decision.</strong> </p>
	    <p>These workers have already participated in two rounds of tasks.</p>
	    <p> These workers were required to answer 5 <strong>easy</strong> SAT math questions in <strong>Round 1</strong> and another 5 <strong>hard</strong> SAT math questions in <strong>Round 2</strong>. <strong>Workers were incentivized to answer as many correct questions as possible</strong>. In other words, they were paid more if they answered more questions correctly. They had five minutes available for each round of the task, and were not allowed to use a calculator.</p>
	    <p> You may or may not receive information on how well the workers performed in <strong>Round 1</strong>, your job is to predict who performed the best in <strong>Round 2</strong>. And your payment will be determined by how the workers you choose actually performed in <strong>Round 2</strong>. </p>
			<p> To have a better understanding of the workersâ€™ task , please see the sample question they were asked below.</p>
						<!-- <p> Their point score was calculated as follows: </p>
            <p> -           They will receive 5 cents as base payment. </p>
						<p> - 					No payment for each incorrect answer. </p>
            <p> -           They will receive 20 cents for each correct answer in first easy part, and 25 cents for each correct answer in second hard part. </p> -->
